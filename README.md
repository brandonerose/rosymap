## Installation

You can install the development version of rosymap like so:

``` r
# install remotes package if you don't have it
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("brandonerose/rosymap")
```

If you have any issues above download the most recent version of R at
RStudtio and update all packages in RStudio. See
[thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started](https://www.thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started "R Getting Started").

## Run

This is how you get REDCap turned into an R database - only for basic
projects at this time

``` r
library("rosymap")
getwd() # make sure you have an R project set up and that you are okay with files being stored here (be careful with cloud drives)
set_dir(file.path(getwd()),F) # replace file.path with wherever you want files from this app to be stored...
run_app() #it's that easy! problems check the documentation and/or email thecodingdocs@gmail.com
```
